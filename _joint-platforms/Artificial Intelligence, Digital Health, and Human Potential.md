This platform has several objectives, including: 

* Advancing the development and implementation of artificial intelligence technologies in healthcare to improve diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases

* Promoting the use of digital health technologies such as wearables, mobile apps, and telemedicine to increase access to healthcare, monitor and manage chronic conditions, and improve patient outcomes
