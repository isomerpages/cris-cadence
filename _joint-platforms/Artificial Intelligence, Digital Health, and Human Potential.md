CADENCE’s **Artificial Intelligence, Digital Health, and Human Potential Platform** leverages the man-machine interface – the power of technology and data – to deliver lifestyle and behavioural coaching in tandem with clinician-pharmacists trained to manage hyperlipidaemia. 

The effective management of hyperlipidaemia, a key modifiable cardiovascular risk factor, through ensuring adequate dosing and adherence to medicines, is key in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

This platform aims to fulfil several objectives, including: 

*   Advancing the development and implementation of artificial intelligence technologies in healthcare to improve treatment of chronic conditions and thus prevention of CVD
    
*   Promoting the use of digital health technologies such as wearables, mobile apps, and telemedicine to increase access to healthcare, to monitor and manage chronic conditions, and to improve patient outcomes
    
This platform aims to improve healthcare outcomes through empowering individuals and communities to live healthier and more fulfilling lives, thereby leading to better management of chronic conditions and improved quality of life, ultimately reducing healthcare costs.

#### **Digital-empowered solution for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in patients with hyperlipidaemia**

Ensuring adherence to lipid-lowering agents is a critical aspect of managing hyperlipidemia. It is estimated that only half of the patients who have been prescribed a statin is taking it as prescribed. Common reasons could be largely attributed to human behaviour - including forgetfulness, fake news, individual’s culture, values and beliefs about health and illness, as well as the lack of understanding around the benefits of treatment. 

The goal of this use case is to implement a hybrid digital health-human coaching solution developed by CADENCE’s Artificial Intelligence, Digital Health, and Human Potential Platform to complement clinician-pharmacists' efforts towards changing patients’ behaviour, improve medication adherence and the optimisation of lipid lowering agents’ dosing in patients with hyperlipidaemia.

This use case is led by:
