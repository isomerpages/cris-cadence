CADENCE's **Artificial Intelligence, Digital Health, and Human Potential Platform** leverages the power of technology and data to deliver lifestyle and pharmacological behavioral interventions which address modifiable cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors for the primary prevention of CVD. 

This platform has several objectives, including: 

* Advancing the development and implementation of artificial intelligence technologies in healthcare to improve diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases.

* Promoting the use of digital health technologies such as wearables, mobile apps, and telemedicine to increase access to healthcare, monitor and manage chronic conditions, and improve patient outcomes.

* Empowering individuals to take control of their health and wellness through personalised, data-driven insights and tools.

This platform improves healthcare outcomes and empowers individuals to live healthier and more fulfilling lives, and could lead to better management of chronic conditions, ultimately reducing healthcare costs, thus improving quality of life for individuals and communities.

#### **Use Case - Digital-empowered solution for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in patients with hyperlipidaemia**

Medication adherence is a critical aspect of managing hyperlipidemia. 

However, human behavior plays a significant role in medication adherence, as patients may struggle with following a medication regimen. Some reasons include forgetfulness, lack of understanding of the medication's benefits, cultural beliefs, as well as individual values and beliefs about health and illness. 

This use case will implement a hybrid digital health-human coaching solution developed by CADENCE's **Artificial Intelligence, Digital Health, and Human Potential Platform** to change patient behaviour and improve medication adherence for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in patients with high cholesterol.
