CADENCE's **Artificial Intelligence, Digital Health, and Human Potential Platform** leverages the power of technology and data to deliver lifestyle and pharmacological behavioral interventions which address modifiable cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors for the primary prevention of CVD. 

This platform has several objectives, including: 

* Advancing the development and implementation of artificial intelligence technologies in healthcare to improve diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases.

* Promoting the use of digital health technologies such as wearables, mobile apps, and telemedicine to increase access to healthcare, monitor and manage chronic conditions, and improve patient outcomes.

* Empowering individuals to take control of their health and wellness through personalised, data-driven insights and tools.

This platform improves healthcare outcomes and empowers individuals to live healthier and more fulfilling lives, and could lead to better management of chronic conditions, ultimately reducing healthcare costs, thus improving quality of life for individuals and communities.
