<p>CADENCE’s&nbsp;<strong>Artificial Intelligence, Digital Health, and Human Potential Platform</strong>&nbsp;leverages
the&nbsp;man-machine interface – the power of technology and data – to&nbsp;deliver
lifestyle and behavioural coaching in tandem with clinician-pharmacists
trained to manage hyperlipidaemia.</p>
<p>The effective management of hyperlipidaemia, a key modifiable cardiovascular
risk factor, through ensuring adequate dosing and adherence to medicines,
is key in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD).</p>
<p>This platform aims to fulfil several objectives, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Advancing&nbsp;the development and implementation of artificial intelligence
technologies in healthcare to improve treatment of chronic conditions and
thus prevention of&nbsp;CVD</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promoting&nbsp;the use of digital health technologies such as wearables,
mobile apps, and telemedicine to increase access to healthcare, to monitor
and manage chronic conditions, and to improve patient&nbsp;outcomes</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This platform aims to improve healthcare outcomes through empowering individuals
and communities to live healthier and more fulfilling lives, thereby leading
to better management of chronic conditions and improved quality of life,
ultimately reducing healthcare costs.</p>

<h4><strong>Digital-empowered solutions for&nbsp;the prevention of cardiovascular disease&nbsp;in primary care</strong></h4>
<p>Ensuring adherence to lipid-lowering agents is a critical aspect of managing
hyperlipidemia. It is estimated that only half of the patients who have
been prescribed a statin is taking it as prescribed. Common reasons could
be largely attributed to human behaviour - including forgetfulness, fake
news, individual’s culture, values and beliefs about health and illness,
as well as the lack of understanding around the benefits of treatment.</p>
<p>The goal of this use case is to implement a hybrid digital health-human
coaching solution developed by CADENCE’s&nbsp;Artificial Intelligence,
Digital Health, and Human Potential Platform&nbsp;to complement clinician-pharmacists'
efforts towards changing patients’ behaviour, improve medication adherence
and the optimisation of lipid lowering agents’ dosing in patients with
hyperlipidaemia.</p>
