#### **Clinical and cost-effectiveness of treatments for patients withÂ heart failure**

Analyses of existing Asian heart failure cohorts have highlighted unique features of Asian heart failure patients when compared to HF patients in the USA and Europe. 

These include earlier age of onset (~10 years), more aggressive disease with worse clinical outcomes, and unique heart failure clinical phenotypes (e.g., lean diabetic patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction).
    
Through this use case, CADENCE aims to: 

*   Inform healthcare policies by influencing prescribing guidelines for heart failure patients  

*   Provide the evidence base for national drug treatment guidelines for heart failure.
