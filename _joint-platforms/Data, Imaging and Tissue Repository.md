<p>CADENCE's <strong>Data, Imaging &amp; Tissue Repository Platform</strong>,
with representation from the National Heart Centre Singapore, National
University Heart Centre, Singapore, and Tan Tock Seng Hospital, in partnership
with Bioinformatics Institute (A*STAR), IHiS, and the Ministry of Health,
looks forward to bring together patient data, cardiovascular disease (CVD)
images and tissue from across the clusters and institutions into a <strong>National Cardiovascular Data Repository</strong> that
can updated in real-time.</p>
<p>Through this platform, we aim to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Transform and integrate large unstructured datasets into a single "fit-for-purpose"
structured dataset and linkage of these datasets to health outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Serve as both a discovery and validation engine for academic and industry
collaborators</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facilitate CVD research to improve health outcomes and clinical care of
CVD patients in Singapore</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By establishing this platform, all CVD research capabilities and resources
established nationwide can be shared through a standardised governance
process to ease access for CADENCE partners, researchers and industrial
collaborators.</p>
<p>This national resource would greatly facilitate the translation of novel
research and innovative discoveries into the clinical setting for patients.</p>
<p>The platform, in collaboration with sister unit SCRI, has also facilitated
in the setup of the <a href="https://ddec1-0-en-ctp.trendmicro.com/wis/clicktime/v1/query?url=https%3a%2f%2fclinicaltrials.sg&amp;umid=93359da1-01ee-4905-a84e-8a6f2b0e4bc8&amp;rct=1740699229&amp;auth=32813f2e647ebb91b39d0b35ac97db1efa82dd64-dfdbee75b0fb42dbc0ab0be7a02bae786a2ef94e" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Singapore's Clinical Trials Portal (CTSG.</u></a> is
crafted to cater to patients, caregivers, clinical investigators and companies
by making clinical trial information more accessible and comprehensible.
By demystifying the clinical trial landscape, CTSG aims to encourage greater
interest in clinical trials, fostering innovation and improving health
outcomes.</p>

<h4><strong>Clinical and cost-effectiveness of treatments for patients with&nbsp;heart failure</strong></h4>
<p>Analyses of existing Asian heart failure cohorts have highlighted unique
features of Asian heart failure patients when compared to HF patients in
the USA and Europe.</p>
<p>These include earlier age of onset (~10 years), more aggressive disease
with worse clinical outcomes, and unique heart failure clinical phenotypes
(e.g., lean diabetic patients with heart failure with preserved ejection
fraction).</p>
<p>Through this use case, CADENCE aims to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Inform healthcare policies by influencing prescribing guidelines for heart
failure patients</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide the evidence base for national drug treatment guidelines for heart
failure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This use case is led by:</p>
