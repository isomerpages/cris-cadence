CADENCE's **Data, Imaging & Tissue Repository Platform** will partner with A\*STAR's Bioinformatics Institute, Integrated Health Information Systems (IHiS), and the Singapore Ministry of Health (MOH) to bring together patient data, cardiovascular disease (CVD) images and tissues from across the healthcare clusters and institutions into a National Cardiovascular Data Repository that can updated in real time. 

Through this platform, we aim to:

*   Transform and integrate large unstructured datasets into a single "fit-for-purpose" structured dataset and linkage of these datasets to health outcomes. 
    
*   Serve as both a discovery and validation engine for academic and industry collaborators. 
    
*   Facilitate CVD research to improve health outcomes and clinical care of CVD patients in Singapore.
    
Through this platform, all CVD research capabilities and resources established nationwide can be shared through a standardised governance process to ease access for CADENCE partners, researchers and industrial collaborators. 

This national resource would greatly facilitate the translation of novel research and innovative discoveries into the clinical setting to benefit patients here.
