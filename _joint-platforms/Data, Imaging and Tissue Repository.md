<p>CADENCE's <strong>Data, Imaging &amp; Tissue Repository Platform</strong>,
with representation from the National Heart Centre Singapore, National
University Heart Centre, Singapore, and Tan Tock Seng Hospital, in partnership
with Bioinformatics Institute (A*STAR), IHiS, and the Ministry of Health,
looks forward to bring together patient data, cardiovascular disease (CVD)
images and tissue from across the clusters and institutions into a <strong>National Cardiovascular Data Repository</strong> that
can updated in real-time.</p>
<p>Through this platform, we aim to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Transform and integrate large unstructured datasets into a single "fit-for-purpose"
structured dataset and linkage of these datasets to health outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Serve as both a discovery and validation engine for academic and industry
collaborators</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facilitate CVD research to improve health outcomes and clinical care of
CVD patients in Singapore</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By establishing this platform, all CVD research capabilities and resources
established nationwide can be shared through a standardised governance
process to ease access for CADENCE partners, researchers and industrial
collaborators.</p>
<p>This national resource would greatly facilitate the translation of novel
research and innovative discoveries into the clinical setting for patients.</p>

<h4><strong>Clinical and cost-effectiveness of treatments for patients with&nbsp;heart failure</strong></h4>
<p>Analyses of existing Asian heart failure cohorts have highlighted unique
features of Asian heart failure patients when compared to HF patients in
the USA and Europe.</p>
<p>These include earlier age of onset (~10 years), more aggressive disease
with worse clinical outcomes, and unique heart failure clinical phenotypes
(e.g., lean diabetic patients with heart failure with preserved ejection
fraction).</p>
<p>Through this use case, CADENCE aims to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Inform healthcare policies by influencing prescribing guidelines for heart
failure patients</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide the evidence base for national drug treatment guidelines for heart
failure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This use case is led by:</p>
