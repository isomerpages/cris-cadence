CADENCE's **Data, Imaging & Tissue Repository Platform**, with representation from the National Heart Centre Singapore, National University Heart Centre, Singapore, and Tan Tock Seng Hospital, in partnership with Bioinformatics Institute (A\*STAR), IHiS, and the Ministry of Health, looks forward to bring together patient data, cardiovascular disease (CVD) images and tissue from across the clusters and institutions into a **National Cardiovascular Data Repository** that can updated in real-time.

Through this platform, we aim to:

*   Transform and integrate large unstructured datasets into a single "fit-for-purpose" structured dataset and linkage of these datasets to health outcomes
    
*   Serve as both a discovery and validation engine for academic and industry collaborators
    
*   Facilitate CVD research to improve health outcomes and clinical care of CVD patients in Singapore
    
By establishing this platform, all CVD research capabilities and resources established nationwide can be shared through a standardised governance process to ease access for CADENCE partners, researchers and industrial collaborators. 

This national resource would greatly facilitate the translation of novel research and innovative discoveries into the clinical setting for patients.

#### **Use Case - Clinical and cost-effectiveness of treatments for patients withÂ heart failure**

Analyses of existing Asian heart failure cohorts have highlighted unique features of Asian heart failure patients when compared to HF patients in the USA and Europe. 

These include earlier age of onset (~10 years), more aggressive disease with worse clinical outcomes, and unique heart failure clinical phenotypes (e.g., lean diabetic patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction).
    
Through this use case, CADENCE aims to: 

*   Inform healthcare policies by influencing prescribing guidelines for heart failure patients  

*   Provide the evidence base for national drug treatment guidelines for heart failure.
