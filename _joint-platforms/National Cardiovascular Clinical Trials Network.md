<p>CADENCE's <strong>National Cardiovascular Clinical Trials Network</strong> brings
together existing cardiovascular (CV) clinical trial units at&nbsp;the
National University Heart Centre Singapore (NUHCS),&nbsp;National Heart
Centre Singapore (NHCS)&nbsp;and Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) to function
as one to support mechanistic early-phase multi-site clinical trials across
Singapore.</p>
<p>This platform will partner with other coordinating bodies being developed
by&nbsp;the <a href="https://scri.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore Clinical Research Institute (SCRI)</a> across&nbsp;all
the clinical domains.</p>
<p>In addition, the National CV Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Unit&nbsp;established
will partner with other business units within the Consortium for Clinical
Research and Innovation, Singapore (CRIS) to scale-up biostatistics and
bioinformatics capabilities at the national level.</p>
<p>Through this platform, we aim to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Provide a&nbsp;centralised&nbsp;platform&nbsp;for the design, implementation,
and conduct of clinical trials in cardiovascular&nbsp;medicine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Streamline&nbsp;the regulatory and administrative processes involved in
conducting clinical&nbsp;trials</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facilitate&nbsp;collaboration and partnerships among researchers, clinicians,
and industry leaders in cardiovascular medicine</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Through&nbsp;this network,&nbsp;the research community will have a unified
platform to conduct more efficient and effective clinical trials, leading
to quicker development and approval of new cardiovascular therapies and
interventions. This would ultimately improve patient outcomes and contribute
to the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.</p>

<h4><strong>AI-empowered imaging solution for earlier detection of&nbsp;cancer-related cardiac dysfunction</strong></h4>
<p>Cancer treatments, including chemotherapies and radiotherapies, increase
the risk of cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>Among many cancer survivors, the risk of mortality from cardiac disease
may be higher than the cancer itself. Consequently, there has been increasing
interest in detecting cancer therapy-associated cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD)
early so that the patients can receive appropriate heart failure treatment.</p>
<p>As a result, the European Society of Cardiology recently released the
first-ever guidelines on cardio-oncology, intended to guide clinicians
to better recognise and treat patients with CTRCD.</p>
<p>Through this Use Case, CADENCE aims to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Evaluate the accuracy, cost-effectiveness, and patient preference of an
AI-echo guided strategy as compared to standard echocardiography in the
detection of CTRCD.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Demonstrate earlier detection of CTRCD using an AI-echo guided strategy
as compared to a standard echocardiography strategy in breast cancer and
lymphoma patients receiving cardiotoxic chemotherapy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This use case is led by:</p>
