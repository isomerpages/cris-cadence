CADENCE's **National Cardiovascular Clinical Trials Network** brings together existing cardiovascular (CV) clinical trial units at the National University Heart Centre Singapore (NUHCS), National Heart Centre Singapore (NHCS) and Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) to function as one to support mechanistic early-phase multi-site clinical trials across Singapore. 

This platform will partner with other coordinating bodies being developed by the Singapore Clinical Research Institute (SCRI) across all the clinical domains. In addition, the National CV Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Unit established will partner with other business units within the Consortium for Clinical Research and Innovation, Singapore (CRIS) to scale-up biostatistics and bioinformatics capabilities at the national level.

Through this platform, we aim to:

* Provide a centralised platform for the design, implementation, and conduct of clinical trials in cardiovascular medicine

* Streamline the regulatory and administrative processes involved in conducting clinical trials

* Facilitate collaboration and partnerships among researchers, clinicians, and industry leaders in cardiovascular medicine

Through this platform, the research community will have a unified platform to conduct more efficient and effective clinical trials, leading to quicker development and approval of new cardiovascular therapies and interventions. This would ultimately improve patient outcomes and contribute to the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
