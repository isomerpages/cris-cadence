Established in February 2023, the **CA**rdiovascular **D**iseas**E** **N**ational **C**ollaborative **E**nterprise (CADENCE) is a national clinical translational programme aimed at synergising cardiovascular research and technology capabilities across Singapore. It is a programme of the [Consortium for Clinical Research and Innovation, Singapore](https://cris.sg) (CRIS).

Singapore has established internationally competitive basic, translational, and clinical research talent, state-of-the-art research facilities, and multi-site clinical research infrastructure in cardiovascular research. These include the National Heart Centre Singapore (NHCS), National University Heart Centre Singapore (NUHCS), Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), National University of Singapore (NUS), SingHealth Duke-NUS Medical School, Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A\*STAR). 

Our goal is to integrate these existing research capabilities, and bring together the strongest basic, clinical, and translational talent and expertise across Singapore and institutions, to establish a focused and impactful national CVD R&T programme with world-class peaks of excellence.

CADENCE will establish four national joint platforms focused on data science, clinical trials, and artificial intelligence/digital health, together with a business intelligence and development unit to attract industry collaborations/external investments.

CADENCE is now in the first stage of implementation, focused on establishing operational capabilities of the four joint platforms.
